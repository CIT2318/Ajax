# Ajax
This repository contains a simple Ajax example. It is based on the films example we have used previously. It allows users to filter films based on the film certificate. To run the example:
* If you haven't already got it, download the films database from https://github.com/CIT2318/mysql-foreign-keys-joins/blob/master/films-db.sql. Import this using phpmyadmin.
* Change the database connection settings in *index.php* to match your database.
* Open *index.php* in a web browser and it should work.

I've added comments to explain both the JavaScript and PHP code.

## On Your Own
* Can you modify this example so that it works with your assignment database instead of the films database.
